         "The traditional distinction does not necessarily reflect modern values, for example, while garnets are relatively inexpensive, a green garnet called tsavorite can be far more valuable than a mid-quality emerald.",
         "Another unscientific term for semi-precious gemstones used in art history and archaeology is hardstone.",
         "Use of the terms 'precious' and 'semi-precious' in a commercial context is, arguably, misleading in that it deceptively implies certain stones are intrinsically more valuable than others, which is not necessarily the case.",
         "In modern times gemstones are identified by gemologists, who describe gems and their characteristics using technical terminology specific to the field of gemology.",
         "The first characteristic a gemologist uses to identify a gemstone is its chemical composition.",
         "For example, diamonds are made of carbon (C) and rubies of aluminium oxide ().",
         "Many gems are crystals which are classified by their crystal system such as cubic or trigonal or monoclinic.",
         "Another term used is habit, the form the gem is usually found in.",

         "Diamonds are graded using a system developed by the Gemological Institute of America (GIA) in the early 1950s.",
         "Historically, all gemstones were graded using the naked eye.",
         "The GIA system included a major innovation: the introduction of 10x magnification as the standard for grading clarity.",
         "Other gemstones are still graded using the naked eye (assuming 20/20 vision).",
         "A mnemonic device, the \"four Cs\" (color, cut, clarity, and carats), has been introduced to help the consumer understand the factors used to grade a diamond.",
         "With modification, these categories can be useful in understanding the grading of all gemstones.",
         "The four criteria carry different weight depending upon whether they are applied to colored gemstones or to colorless diamonds.",
         "In diamonds, cut is the primary determinant of value, followed by clarity and color.",
         "Diamonds are meant to sparkle, to break down light into its constituent rainbow colors (dispersion), chop it up into bright little pieces (scintillation), and deliver it to the eye (brilliance).",
         "In its rough crystalline form, a diamond will do none of these things; it requires proper fashioning and this is called \"cut\".",
         "In gemstones that have color, including colored diamonds, it is the purity and beauty of that color that is the primary determinant of quality.",
         "Physical characteristics that make a colored stone valuable are color, clarity to a lesser extent (emeralds will always have a number of inclusions), cut, unusual optical phenomena within the stone such as color zoning (the uneven distribution of coloring within a gem) and asteria (star effects).",
         "The Greeks, for example, greatly valued asteria gemstones, which were regarded as powerful love charms, and Helen of Troy was known to have worn star-corundum.",
         "Aside from the diamond, the ruby, sapphire, emerald, pearl (not, strictly speaking, a gemstone), and opal have also been considered to be precious.",
         "Up to the discoveries of bulk amethyst in Brazil in the 19th century, amethyst was considered a \"precious stone\" as well, going back to ancient Greece.",
         "Even in the last century certain stones such as aquamarine, peridot and cat's eye (cymophane) have been popular and hence been regarded as precious.",
         "Today such a distinction is no longer made by the gemstone trade.",
         "Many gemstones are used in even the most expensive jewelry, depending on the brand name of the designer, fashion trends, market supply, treatments, etc.",
         "Nevertheless, diamonds, rubies, sapphires, and emeralds still have a reputation that exceeds those of other gemstones.",
         "Rare or unusual gemstones, generally meant to include those gemstones which occur so infrequently in gem quality that they are scarcely known except to connoisseurs, include andalusite, axinite, cassiterite, clinohumite and red beryl.",
         "Gemstone pricing and value are governed by factors and characteristics on the quality of the stone.",
         "These characteristics include clarity, rarity, freedom of defects, beauty of the stone, as well as the demand for them.",
         "There are different pricing influencers for both colored gemstones, and for diamonds.",
         "The pricing on colored stones is determined by market supply-and-demand, but diamonds are more intricate.",

         "A stone can be called \"pink\" by one lab while another lab calls it \"padparadscha\".",
         "One lab can conclude a stone is untreated, while another lab might conclude that it is heat-treated.",
         "To minimise such differences, seven of the most respected labs, AGTA-GTL (New York), CISGEM (Milano), GAAJ-ZENHOKYO (Tokyo), GIA (Carlsbad), GIT (Bangkok), Gübelin (Lucerne) and SSEF (Basel), have established the Laboratory Manual Harmonisation Committee (LMHC), for the standardization of wording reports, promotion of certain analytical methods and interpretation of results.",
         "Country of origin has sometimes been difficult to determine, due to the constant discovery of new source locations.",
         "Determining a \"country of origin\" is thus much more difficult than determining other aspects of a gem (such as cut, clarity, etc.).",
         "Gem dealers are aware of the differences between gem laboratories and will make use of the discrepancies to obtain the best possible certificate.",

         "This small factory cuts thousands of carats of sapphire annually.",
         "The two main classifications are stones cut as smooth, dome shaped stones called cabochons, and stones which are cut with a faceting machine by polishing small flat windows called facets at regular intervals at exact angles.",
         "Stones which are opaque or semi-opaque such as opal, turquoise, variscite, etc.",
         "are commonly cut as cabochons.",
         "These gems are designed to show the stone's color or surface properties as in opal and star sapphires.",
         "Grinding wheels and polishing agents are used to grind, shape and polish the smooth dome shape of the stones.",
         "Gems which are transparent are normally faceted, a method which shows the optical properties of the stone's interior to its best advantage by maximizing reflected light which is perceived by the viewer as sparkle.",
         "There are many commonly used shapes for faceted stones.",
         "The facets must be cut at the proper angles, which varies depending on the optical properties of the gem.",
         "If the angles are too steep or too shallow, the light will pass through and not be reflected back toward the viewer.",
         "The faceting machine is used to hold the stone onto a flat lap for cutting and polishing the flat facets.",
         "Rarely, some cutters use special curved laps to cut and polish curved facets.",
         "Section::::Colors.",
         "The color of any material is due to the nature of light itself.",
         "Daylight, often called white light, is all of the colors of the spectrum combined.",
         "When light strikes a material, most of the light is absorbed while a smaller amount of a particular frequency or wavelength is reflected.",
         "The part that is reflected reaches the eye as the perceived color.",
         "A ruby appears red because it absorbs all the other colors of white light, while reflecting the red.",
         "A material which is mostly the same can exhibit different colors.",
         "For example, ruby and sapphire have the same primary chemical composition (both are corundum) but exhibit different colors because of impurities.",
         "Even the same named gemstone can occur in many different colors: sapphires show different shades of blue and pink and \"fancy sapphires\" exhibit a whole range of other colors from yellow to orange-pink, the latter called \"padparadscha sapphire\".",
         "This difference in color is based on the atomic structure of the stone.",
         "Although the different stones formally have the same chemical composition and structure, they are not exactly the same.",
         "Every now and then an atom is replaced by a completely different atom, sometimes as few as one in a million atoms.",
         "These so-called impurities are sufficient to absorb certain colors and leave the other colors unaffected.",
         "For example, beryl, which is colorless in its pure mineral form, becomes emerald with chromium impurities.",
         "If manganese is added instead of chromium, beryl becomes pink morganite.",
         "With iron, it becomes aquamarine.",
         "Some gemstone treatments make use of the fact that these impurities can be \"manipulated\", thus changing the color of the gem.",
         "Section::::Treatment.",
         "Gemstones are often treated to enhance the color or clarity of the stone.",
         "Depending on the type and extent of treatment, they can affect the value of the stone.",
         "Some treatments are used widely because the resulting gem is stable, while others are not accepted most commonly because the gem color is unstable and may revert to the original tone.",
         "Section::::Treatment.:Heat.",
         "Heat can improve gemstone color or clarity.",
         "The heating process has been well known to gem miners and cutters for centuries, and in many stone types heating is a common practice.",
         "Most citrine is made by heating amethyst, and partial heating with a strong gradient results in “ametrine” – a stone partly amethyst and partly citrine.",
         "Aquamarine is often heated to remove yellow tones, or to change green colors into the more desirable blue, or enhance its existing blue color to a purer blue.",
         "Nearly all tanzanite is heated at low temperatures to remove brown undertones and give a more desirable blue / purple color.",
         "A considerable portion of all sapphire and ruby is treated with a variety of heat treatments to improve both color and clarity.",
         "When jewelry containing diamonds is heated (for repairs) the diamond should be protected with boric acid; otherwise the diamond (which is pure carbon) could be burned on the surface or even burned completely up.",
         "When jewelry containing sapphires or rubies is heated, those stones should not be coated with boracic acid (which can etch the surface) or any other substance.",
         "They do not have to be protected from burning, like a diamond (although the stones \"do\" need to be protected from heat stress fracture by immersing the part of the jewelry with stones in water when metal parts are heated).",
         "Section::::Treatment.:Radiation.",
         "Virtually all blue topaz, both the lighter and the darker blue shades such as \"London\" blue, has been irradiated to change the color from white to blue.",
         "Most greened quartz (Oro Verde) is also irradiated to achieve the yellow-green color.",
         "Diamonds are irradiated to produce fancy-color diamonds (which occur naturally, though rarely in gem quality).",
         "Section::::Treatment.:Waxing/oiling.",
         "Emeralds containing natural fissures are sometimes filled with wax or oil to disguise them.",
         "This wax or oil is also colored to make the emerald appear of better color as well as clarity.",

         "Section::::Treatment.",
         ":Fracture filling.",
         "Fracture filling has been in use with different gemstones such as diamonds, emeralds and sapphires.",
         "In 2006 \"glass filled rubies\" received publicity.",
         "Rubies over 10 carats (2 g) with large fractures were filled with lead glass, thus dramatically improving the appearance (of larger rubies in particular).",
         "Such treatments are fairly easy to detect.",
         "Section::::Synthetic and artificial gemstones.",
         "It is important to distinguish between synthetic gemstones, and imitation or simulated gems.",
         "Synthetic gems are physically, optically and chemically identical to the natural stone, but are created in controlled conditions in a laboratory.",
         "Imitation or simulated stones are chemically different from the natural stone but may be optically similar to it; they can be glass, plastic, resins or other compounds.",
         "Examples of simulated or imitation stones include cubic zirconia, composed of zirconium oxide and simulated moissanite, which are both diamond simulants.",
         "The imitations copy the look and color of the real stone but possess neither their chemical nor physical characteristics.",
         "Moissanite actually has a higher refractive index than diamond and when presented beside an equivalently sized and cut diamond will have more \"fire\" than the diamond.",
         "Synthetic, cultured or lab-created gemstones are not imitations.",
         "For example, diamonds, rubies, sapphires and emeralds have been manufactured in labs to possess identical chemical and physical characteristics to the naturally occurring variety.",
         "Synthetic (lab created) corundum, including ruby and sapphire, is very common and costs much less than the natural stones.",
         "Smaller synthetic diamonds have been manufactured in large quantities as industrial abrasives, although larger gem-quality synthetic diamonds are becoming available in multiple carats.",
         "Whether a gemstone is a natural stone or lab-created (synthetic), the physical characteristics are the same.",
         "Lab-created stones tend to have a more vivid color to them, as impurities are not present in a lab and do not modify the clarity or color of the stone, unless added intentionally for a specific purpose.",

         "I don't like my words when I listen to it.",
         "They are accusatory and condescending, not fully thought out, and too easy to misconstrue\".",
         "Van Zant's other response was also controversial, with references to the Governor of Alabama, George Wallace (a noted supporter of segregation) and the Watergate scandal:\n It has been pointed out that the choice of Birmingham in connection with the governor (rather than the capital Montgomery) is significant for the controversy as \"In 1963, the city was the site of massive civil rights activism, as thousands of demonstrators led by Martin Luther King, Jr. sought to desegregate downtown businesses... [and] was the scene of some of the most violent moments of the Civil Rights Movement.",
         "Segregationist police chief Bull Connor unleashed attack dogs and high-pressure water cannons against peaceful marchers, including women and children; just weeks later, Ku Klux Klansmen bombed a black church, killing four little girls.\"",
         "In 1975, Van Zant said: \"The lyrics about the governor of Alabama were misunderstood.",

         "Boo!'",
         "after that particular line, and the media picked up only on the reference to the people loving the governor.\"",
         "\"The line 'We all did what we could do' is sort of ambiguous,\" Al Kooper notes.",
         "\"'We tried to get Wallace out of there' is how I always thought of it.\"",
         "Towards the end of the song, Van Zant adds \"where the governor's true\" to the chorus's \"where the skies are so blue,\" a line rendered ironic by the previous booing of the governor.",
         "Journalist Al Swenson argues that the song is more complex than it is sometimes given credit for, suggesting that it only looks like an endorsement of Wallace.",
         "\"Wallace and I have very little in common,\" Van Zant himself said, \"I don't like what he says about colored people.\"",
         "Music historians examining the juxtaposition of invoking Richard Nixon and Watergate after Wallace and Birmingham note that one reading of the lyrics is an \"attack against the liberals who were so outraged at Nixon's conduct\" while others interpret it regionally: \"the band was speaking for the entire South, saying to northerners, we're not judging you as ordinary citizens for the failures of your leaders in Watergate; don't judge all of us as individuals for the racial problems of southern society\".",
         "It can further be added that Ronnie Van Zant wore a Neil Young t-shirt (with the image of Young's Tonight's The Night LP cover) at several occasions, for instance at the concert at Oakland Coliseum Stadium, California, on February 7, 1977 and also on the \"Street Survivors\" LP cover.",

         "Johnson helped refine many of the songs first heard publicly on the \"Pronounced\" album, and it was Van Zant's \"tip of the hat\" to Johnson for helping out the band in the early years and essentially giving the band its first break.",

         "It reached number 8 on the US chart in 1974 and was the band's second hit single.",

         "Ronnie and I were sitting there, and he kept saying, 'play that again'.",
         "Then Ronnie wrote the lyrics and Ed and I wrote the music.\"",

         "The hit led to two TV rock show offers, which the band turned down.",
         "In addition to the original appearance on \"Second Helping\", the song has appeared on numerous Lynyrd Skynyrd collections and live albums.",
         "Section::::Controversy.",
         "\"Sweet Home Alabama\" was written as an answer to two songs by Neil Young, \"Southern Man\" and \"Alabama\", which dealt with themes of racism and slavery in the American South.",
         "\"We thought Neil was shooting all the ducks in order to kill one or two,\" said Ronnie Van Zant at the time.",
         "The following excerpt shows the Neil Young mention in the song:\n In his 2012 autobiography \"Waging Heavy Peace\", Young commented on his role in the song's creation, writing \"My own song 'Alabama' richly deserved the shot Lynyrd Skynyrd gave me with their great record.",
         "I don't like my words when I listen to it.",
         "They are accusatory and condescending, not fully thought out, and too easy to misconstrue\".",
         "Van Zant's other response was also controversial, with references to the Governor of Alabama, George Wallace (a noted supporter of segregation) and the Watergate scandal:\n It has been pointed out that the choice of Birmingham in connection with the governor (rather than the capital Montgomery) is significant for the controversy as \"In 1963, the city was the site of massive civil rights activism, as thousands of demonstrators led by Martin Luther King, Jr. sought to desegregate downtown businesses... [and] was the scene of some of the most violent moments of the Civil Rights Movement.",
         "Segregationist police chief Bull Connor unleashed attack dogs and high-pressure water cannons against peaceful marchers, including women and children; just weeks later, Ku Klux Klansmen bombed a black church, killing four little girls.\"",
         "In 1975, Van Zant said: \"The lyrics about the governor of Alabama were misunderstood.",
         "The general public didn't notice the words 'Boo!",
         "Boo!",
         "Boo!'",
         "after that particular line, and the media picked up only on the reference to the people loving the governor.\"",
         "\"The line 'We all did what we could do' is sort of ambiguous,\" Al Kooper notes.",
         "\"'We tried to get Wallace out of there' is how I always thought of it.\"",
         "Towards the end of the song, Van Zant adds \"where the governor's true\" to the chorus's \"where the skies are so blue,\" a line rendered ironic by the previous booing of the governor.",
         "Journalist Al Swenson argues that the song is more complex than it is sometimes given credit for, suggesting that it only looks like an endorsement of Wallace.",
         "\"Wallace and I have very little in common,\" Van Zant himself said, \"I don't like what he says about colored people.\"",
         "Music historians examining the juxtaposition of invoking Richard Nixon and Watergate after Wallace and Birmingham note that one reading of the lyrics is an \"attack against the liberals who were so outraged at Nixon's conduct\" while others interpret it regionally: \"the band was speaking for the entire South, saying to northerners, we're not judging you as ordinary citizens for the failures of your leaders in Watergate; don't judge all of us as individuals for the racial problems of southern society\".",
         "It can further be added that Ronnie Van Zant wore a Neil Young t-shirt (with the image of Young's Tonight's The Night LP cover) at several occasions, for instance at the concert at Oakland Coliseum Stadium, California, on February 7, 1977 and also on the \"Street Survivors\" LP cover.",

         "The nickname \"The Swampers\" was given to the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section by producer Denny Cordell during a recording session by singer/songwriter Leon Russell, in reference to their 'swampy' sound.",
         "Part of the reference comes from the 1971–1972 demo reels that Lynyrd Skynyrd had recorded in Muscle Shoals with Johnson as a producer/recording engineer.",
         "Johnson helped refine many of the songs first heard publicly on the \"Pronounced\" album, and it was Van Zant's \"tip of the hat\" to Johnson for helping out the band in the early years and essentially giving the band its first break.",

         "The owners hire veteran whaler Owen Chase as first mate, though he is disappointed not to receive a captain's commission.",

         "Denying the story as a myth, Pollard and Chase lead the expedition west.",
         "They find the undisturbed grounds, but when they launch the whaling boats, the white whale, a massive albino bull sperm whale attacks, damaging the boats and turning on the ship.",
         "Chase harpoons it from the \"Essex\"s deck, but the whale staves the ship in half, killing two men.",
         "The crew abandons the sinking \"Essex\" in the three intact whaling boats, and must sail hundreds of miles to shore with very limited supplies.",
         "The whale follows and attacks again, but they escape to the tiny Henderson Island.",
         "While gathering food, Chase discovers the corpses of earlier castaways, and concludes that the crew will soon die on the island before another ship passes by.",
         "Four men decide to stay, while the rest set sail again on the boats with hopes to find land.",
         "Soon after, one of the men dies, and the remaining crew reluctantly decide to cannibalize him.",
         "The older Nickerson is overcome by emotion and stops his story; however, when his wife comforts him, he feels encouraged enough to finish.",
         "Back in the 1820s, the three boats separate and one is lost.",
         "The other two further resort to cannibalism to survive, with Pollard's cousin Henry Coffin sacrificing himself.",

         "All humans have two copies of the Huntingtin gene (\"HTT\"), which codes for the protein Huntingtin (HTT).",
         "The gene is also called \"HD\" and \"IT15\", which stands for 'interesting transcript 15'.",
         "Part of this gene is a repeated section called a trinucleotide repeat, which varies in length between individuals and may change length between generations.",
         "If the repeat is present in a healthy gene, a dynamic mutation may increase the repeat count and result in a defective gene.",
         "When the length of this repeated section reaches a certain threshold, it produces an altered form of the protein, called mutant Huntingtin protein (mHTT).",
         "The differing functions of these proteins are the cause of pathological changes which in turn cause the disease symptoms.",
         "The Huntington's disease mutation is genetically dominant and almost fully penetrant: mutation of either of a person's \"HTT\" alleles causes the disease.",
         "It is not inherited according to sex, but the length of the repeated section of the gene and hence its severity can be influenced by the sex of the affected parent.",
         "Section::::Genetics.",
         ":Genetic mutation.",
         "HD is one of several trinucleotide repeat disorders which are caused by the length of a repeated section of a gene exceeding a normal range.",
         "The \"HTT\" gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 4 at 4p16.3.",
         "\"HTT\" contains a sequence of three DNA bases—cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG)—repeated multiple times (i.e. ...",
         "CAGCAGCAG ...), known as a trinucleotide repeat.",
         "CAG is the 3-letter genetic code (codon) for the amino acid glutamine, so a series of them results in the production of a chain of glutamine known as a polyglutamine tract (or polyQ tract), and the repeated part of the gene, the \"PolyQ region\".",
         "Generally, people have fewer than 36 repeated glutamines in the polyQ region which results in production of the cytoplasmic protein Huntingtin.",
         "However, a sequence of 36 or more glutamines results in the production of a protein which has different characteristics.",
         "This altered form, called mutant huntingtin (mHTT), increases the decay rate of certain types of neurons.",
         "Regions of the brain have differing amounts and reliance on these types of neurons, and are affected accordingly.",
         "Generally, the number of CAG repeats is related to how much this process is affected, and accounts for about 60% of the variation of the age of the onset of symptoms.",
         "The remaining variation is attributed to environment and other genes that modify the mechanism of HD.",
         "36–39 repeats result in a reduced-penetrance form of the disease, with a much later onset and slower progression of symptoms.",
         "In some cases the onset may be so late that symptoms are never noticed.",
         "With very large repeat counts, HD has full penetrance and can occur under the age of 20, when it is then referred to as juvenile HD, akinetic-rigid, or Westphal variant HD.",
         "This accounts for about 7% of HD carriers.",
         "Section::::Genetics.:Inheritance.",
         "Huntington's disease has autosomal dominant inheritance, meaning that an affected individual typically inherits one copy of the gene with an expanded trinucleotide repeat (the mutant allele) from an affected parent.",
         "Since penetrance of the mutation is very high, those who have a mutated copy of the gene will have the disease.",
         "In this type of inheritance pattern, each offspring of an affected individual has a 50% risk of inheriting the mutant allele and therefore being affected with the disorder (see figure).",
         "This probability is sex-independent.",
         "Trinucleotide CAG repeats over 28 are unstable during replication, and this instability increases with the number of repeats present.",
         "This usually leads to new expansions as generations pass (dynamic mutations) instead of reproducing an exact copy of the trinucleotide repeat.",
         "This causes the number of repeats to change in successive generations, such that an unaffected parent with an \"intermediate\" number of repeats (28–35), or \"reduced penetrance\" (36–40), may pass on a copy of the gene with an increase in the number of repeats that produces fully penetrant HD.",
         "Such increases in the number of repeats (and hence earlier age of onset and severity of disease) in successive generations is known as genetic anticipation.",
         "Instability is greater in spermatogenesis than oogenesis; maternally inherited alleles are usually of a similar repeat length, whereas paternally inherited ones have a higher chance of increasing in length.",
         "It is rare for Huntington's disease to be caused by a new mutation, where neither parent has over 36 CAG repeats.",
         "In the rare situations where both parents have an expanded HD gene, the risk increases to 75%, and when either parent has two expanded copies, the risk is 100% (all children will be affected).",
         "Individuals with both genes affected are rare.",
         "For some time HD was thought to be the only disease for which possession of a second mutated gene did not affect symptoms and progression, but it has since been found that it can affect the phenotype and the rate of progression.",

         "The huntingtin protein interacts with over 100 other proteins, and appears to have multiple biological functions.",
         "The behavior of this mutated protein is not completely understood, but it is toxic to certain cell types, particularly in the brain.",
         "Early damage is most evident in the striatum, but as the disease progresses, other areas of the brain are also more conspicuously affected.",
         "Early symptoms are attributable to functions of the striatum and its cortical connections—namely control over movement, mood and higher cognitive function.",

         "The function of HTT in humans is unclear.",
         "It interacts with proteins which are involved in transcription, cell signaling, and intracellular transporting.",
         "In animals genetically modified to exhibit HD, several functions of HTT have been found.",
         "In these animals, HTT is important for embryonic development, as its absence is related to embryonic death.",
         "Caspase, an enzyme which plays a role in catalyzing apoptosis, is thought to be activated by the mutated gene through damaging the ubiquitin-protease system.",
         "It also acts as an anti-apoptotic agent preventing programmed cell death and controls the production of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, a protein which protects neurons and regulates their creation during neurogenesis.",
         "HTT also facilitates vesicular transport and synaptic transmission and controls neuronal gene transcription.",
         "If the expression of HTT is increased and more HTT produced, brain cell survival is improved and the effects of mHTT are reduced, whereas when the expression of HTT is reduced, the resulting characteristics are more typical of the presence of mHTT.",
         "It is thought that the disease is not caused by inadequate production of HTT, but by an increase in the toxic function of mHTT in the body.",
         "Section::::Mechanism.",
         ":Cellular changes.",
         "There are multiple cellular changes through which the toxic function of mHTT may manifest and produce the HD pathology.",
         "In its mutant (i.e.",
         "polyglutamine expanded) form, the protein is more prone to cleavage that creates shorter fragments containing the polyglutamine expansion.",
         "These protein fragments have a propensity to undergo misfolding and aggregation, yielding fibrillar aggregates in which non-native polyglutamine β-strands from multiple proteins are bonded together via hydrogen bonds.",
         "These aggregates share the same fundamental cross-β amyloid architecture seen in other protein deposition diseases.",
         "Over time, the aggregates accumulate to form inclusion bodies within cells, ultimately interfering with neuron function.",
         "Neuronal inclusions run indirect interference.",
         "Inclusion bodies have been found in both the cell nucleus and cytoplasm.",
         "Inclusion bodies in cells of the brain are one of the earliest pathological changes, and some experiments have found that they can be toxic for the cell, but other experiments have shown that they may form as part of the body's defense mechanism and help protect cells.",
         "Several pathways by which mHTT may cause cell death have been identified.",
         "These include: effects on chaperone proteins, which help fold proteins and remove misfolded ones; interactions with caspases, which play a role in the process of removing cells; the toxic effects of glutamine on nerve cells; impairment of energy production within cells; and effects on the expression of genes.",
         "An additional theory that explains another way cell function may be disrupted by HD proposes that damage to mitochondria in striatal cells is of central importance (numerous accounts of mitochondrial metabolism deficiency have been found).",
         "Mutant Huntingtin protein has been found to play a key role in mitochondrial dysfunction.",
         "The impairment of mitochondrial electron transport can result in higher levels of oxidative stress and release of reactive oxygen species.",
         "The interactions of the altered huntingtin protein with numerous proteins in neurons leads to an increased vulnerability of glutamine, which, in large amounts, has been found to be an excitotoxin.",
         "Excitotoxins may cause damage to numerous cellular structures.",
         "Although glutamine is not found in excessively high amounts, it has been postulated that because of the increased vulnerability, even normal amounts of glutamine can cause excitotoxins to be expressed.",

         ":Macroscopic changes.",
         "HD affects the whole brain, but certain areas are more vulnerable than others.",
         "The most prominent early effects are in a part of the basal ganglia called the neostriatum, which is composed of the caudate nucleus and putamen.",
         "Other areas affected include the substantia nigra, layers 3, 5 and 6 of the cerebral cortex, the hippocampus, purkinje cells in the cerebellum, lateral tuberal nuclei of the hypothalamus and parts of the thalamus.",
         "These areas are affected according to their structure and the types of neurons they contain, reducing in size as they lose cells.",
         "Striatal spiny neurons are the most vulnerable, particularly ones with projections towards the external globus pallidus, with interneurons and spiny cells projecting to the internal pallidum being less affected.",
         "HD also causes an abnormal increase in astrocytes and activation of the brain's immune cells, microglia.",
         "The basal ganglia—the part of the brain most prominently affected in early HD—play a key role in movement and behavior control.",
         "Their functions are not fully understood, but current theories propose that they are part of the cognitive executive system and the motor circuit.",
         "The basal ganglia ordinarily inhibit a large number of circuits that generate specific movements.",
         "To initiate a particular movement, the cerebral cortex sends a signal to the basal ganglia that causes the inhibition to be released.",
         "Damage to the basal ganglia can cause the release or reinstatement of the inhibitions to be erratic and uncontrolled, which results in an awkward start to motion or motions to be unintentionally initiated, or a motion to be halted before, or beyond, its intended completion.",
         "The accumulating damage to this area causes the characteristic erratic movements associated with HD.",
         "The spontaneous and erratic physical movements associated with HD are classified as a type of hyperkinetic dysarthria.",
         "Because of the basal ganglia's inability to inhibit movements, individuals affected by it will inevitably experience a reduced ability to produce speech and swallow foods and liquids (dysphagia).",
         "Section::::Mechanism.",
         ":Transcriptional dysregulation.",
         "CREB-binding protein (CBP), a transcriptional coregulator, is essential for cell function because as a coactivator at a significant number of promoters, it activates the transcription of genes for survival pathways.",
         "Furthermore, the amino acids that form CBP include a strip of 18 glutamines.",
         "Thus, the glutamines on CBP interact directly with the increased numbers of glutamine on the HTT chain and CBP gets pulled away from its typical location next to the nucleus.",
         "Specifically, CBP contains an acetyltransferase domain to which HTT binds through its polyglutamine-containing domain.",
         "Autopsied brains of those who had Huntington's disease also have been found to have incredibly reduced amounts of CBP.",
         "In addition, when CBP is overexpressed, polyglutamine-induced death is diminished, further demonstrating that CBP plays an important role in Huntington's disease and neurons in general.",

         "At that time surveys indicated that 50–70% of at-risk individuals would have been interested in receiving testing, but since predictive testing has been offered far fewer choose to be tested.",
         "Over 95% of individuals at risk of inheriting HD do not proceed with testing, mostly because there is no treatment.",

         "Life expectancy in HD is generally around 20 years following the onset of visible symptoms.",
         "Most life-threatening complications result from muscle coordination and, to a lesser extent, behavioral changes induced by declining cognitive function.",
         "The largest risk is pneumonia, which causes death in one third of those with HD.",
         "As the ability to synchronize movements deteriorates, difficulty clearing the lungs and an increased risk of aspirating food or drink both increase the risk of contracting pneumonia.",
         "The second greatest risk is heart disease, which causes almost a quarter of fatalities of those with HD.",

         "Prevalence is similar for men and women.",
         "The rate of occurrence is highest in peoples of Western European descent, averaging around 7 per 100,000 people, and is lower in the rest of the world; e.g., one per million people of Asian and African descent.",
         "A 2013 epidemiological study of the prevalence of Huntington's disease in the UK between 1990 and 2010 found that the average prevalence for the UK was 12.3 per 100,000.",
         "Additionally, some localized areas have a much higher prevalence than their regional average.",
         "One of the highest incidences is in the isolated populations of the Lake Maracaibo region of Venezuela, where HD affects up to 700 per 100,000 persons.",
         "Other areas of high localization have been found in Tasmania and specific regions of Scotland, Wales and Sweden.",
         "Increased prevalence in some cases occurs due to a local founder effect, a historical migration of carriers into an area of geographic isolation.",
         "Some of these carriers have been traced back hundreds of years using genealogical studies.",
         "Genetic haplotypes can also give clues for the geographic variations of prevalence.",
         "Iceland, on the contrary, has a rather low prevalence of 1 per 100,000, despite the fact that Icelanders as a people are descended of the early Germanic tribes of Scandinavia which also gave rise to the Swedes; all cases with the exception of one going back nearly two centuries having derived from the offspring of a couple living early in the 19th century.",
         "Finland, as well, has a low incidence of only 2.2 per 100,000 people.",
         "Until the discovery of a genetic test, statistics could only include clinical diagnosis based on physical symptoms and a family history of HD, excluding those who died of other causes before diagnosis.",
         "These cases can now be included in statistics; and, as the test becomes more widely available, estimates of the prevalence and incidence of the disorder are likely to increase.",
         "Section::::History.",
         "Although Huntington's has been recognized as a disorder since at least the Middle Ages, the cause has been unknown until fairly recently.",
         "Huntington's was given different names throughout this history as understanding of the disease changed.",
         "Originally called simply 'chorea' for the jerky dancelike movements associated with the disease, HD has also been called \"hereditary chorea\" and \"chronic progressive chorea\".",
         "The first definite mention of HD was in a letter by Charles Oscar Waters, published in the first edition of Robley Dunglison's \"Practice of Medicine\" in 1842.",
         "Waters described \"a form of chorea, vulgarly called magrums\", including accurate descriptions of the chorea, its progression, and the strong heredity of the disease.",
         "In 1846 Charles Gorman observed how higher prevalence seemed to occur in localized regions.",
         "Independently of Gorman and Waters, both students of Dunglison at Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia, Johan Christian Lund also produced an early description in 1860.",
         "He specifically noted that in Setesdalen, a secluded mountain valley in Norway, there was a high prevalence of dementia associated with a pattern of jerking movement disorders that ran in families.",
         "The first thorough description of the disease was by George Huntington in 1872.",
         "Examining the combined medical history of several generations of a family exhibiting similar symptoms, he realized their conditions must be linked; he presented his detailed and accurate definition of the disease as his first paper.",
         "Huntington described the exact pattern of inheritance of autosomal dominant disease years before the rediscovery by scientists of Mendelian inheritance.",
         "\"Of its hereditary nature.",
         "When either or both the parents have shown manifestations of the disease ..., one or more of the offspring almost invariably suffer from the disease ...",
         "But if by any chance these children go through life without it, the thread is broken and the grandchildren and great-grandchildren of the original shakers may rest assured that they are free from the disease.\".",
         "Sir William Osler was interested in the disorder and chorea in general, and was impressed with Huntington's paper, stating that \"In the history of medicine, there are few instances in which a disease has been more accurately, more graphically or more briefly described.\"",
         "Osler's continued interest in HD, combined with his influence in the field of medicine, helped to rapidly spread awareness and knowledge of the disorder throughout the medical community.",
         "Great interest was shown by scientists in Europe, including Louis Théophile Joseph Landouzy, Désiré-Magloire Bourneville, Camillo Golgi, and Joseph Jules Dejerine, and until the end of the century, much of the research into HD was European in origin.",
         "By the end of the 19th century, research and reports on HD had been published in many countries and the disease was recognized as a worldwide condition.",
         "During the rediscovery of Mendelian inheritance at the turn of the 20th century, HD was used tentatively as an example of autosomal dominant inheritance.",
         "The English biologist William Bateson used the pedigrees of affected families to establish that HD had an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern.",
         "The strong inheritance pattern prompted several researchers, including Smith Ely Jelliffe, to attempt to trace and connect family members of previous studies.",
         "Jelliffe collected information from across New York and published several articles regarding the genealogy of HD in New England.",
         "Jelliffe's research roused the interest of his college friend, Charles Davenport, who commissioned Elizabeth Muncey to produce the first field study on the East Coast of the United States of families with HD and to construct their pedigrees.",
         "Davenport used this information to document the variable age of onset and range of symptoms of HD; he claimed that most cases of HD in the USA could be traced back to a handful of individuals.",
         "This research was further embellished in 1932 by P. R. Vessie, who popularized the idea that three brothers who left England in 1630 bound for Boston were the progenitors of HD in the USA.",
         "The claim that the earliest progenitors had been established and eugenic bias of Muncey's, Davenport's, and Vessie's work contributed to misunderstandings and prejudice about HD.",
         "Muncey and Davenport also popularized the idea that in the past some HD sufferers may have been thought to be possessed by spirits or victims of witchcraft, and were sometimes shunned or exiled by society.",
         "This idea has not been proven.",
         "Researchers have found contrary evidence; for instance, the community of the family studied by George Huntington openly accommodated those who exhibited symptoms of HD.",
         "The search for the cause of this condition was enhanced considerably in 1968, when the Hereditary Disease Foundation (HDF) was created by Milton Wexler, a psychoanalyst based in Los Angeles, California, whose wife Leonore Sabin had been diagnosed earlier that year with Huntington's disease.",
         "The three brothers of Wexler's wife also suffered from this disease.",
         "The foundation was involved in the recruitment of over 100 scientists in the Huntington's Disease Collaborative Research Project who over a 10-year period worked to locate the responsible gene.",
         "Thanks to the HDF, the ongoing US-Venezuela Huntington's Disease Collaborative Research Project was started in 1979, and reported a major breakthrough in 1983 with the discovery of the approximate location of a causal gene.",
         "This was the result of an extensive study focusing on the populations of two isolated Venezuelan villages, Barranquitas and Lagunetas, where there was an unusually high prevalence of the disease.",
         "It involved over 18,000 people—mostly from a single extended family.",
         "Among other innovations, the project developed DNA-marking methods which were an important step in making the Human Genome Project possible.",
         "In 1993, the research group isolated the precise causal gene at 4p16.3, making this the first autosomal disease locus found using genetic linkage analysis.",
         "In the same time frame, key discoveries concerning the mechanisms of the disorder were being made, including the findings by Anita Harding's research group on the effects of the gene's length.",
         "Modelling the disease in various types of animals, such as the transgenic mouse developed in 1996, enabled larger scale experiments.",
         "As these animals have faster metabolisms and much shorter lifespans than humans, results from experiments are received sooner, speeding research.",
         "The 1997 discovery that mHTT fragments misfold led to the discovery of the nuclear inclusions they cause.",
         "These advances have led to increasingly extensive research into the proteins involved with the disease, potential drug treatments, care methods, and the gene itself.",
         "The condition was formerly called 'Huntington's chorea' but this term has been replaced by 'Huntington's disease' because not all patients develop chorea and due to the importance of cognitive and behavioral problems.",

         "There was controversy when Charles Davenport proposed in 1910 that compulsory sterilization and immigration control be used for people with certain diseases, including HD, as part of the eugenics movement.",
         "In vitro fertilization has some issues regarding its use of embryos.",
         "Some HD research has ethical issues due to its use of animal testing and embryonic stem cells.",

         "The United Kingdom's insurance companies have agreed with the Department of Health and Social Care that until 2017 customers need not disclose predictive genetics tests to them, but this agreement explicitly excludes the government-approved test for Huntington's when writing policies with a value over .",
         "As with other untreatable genetic conditions with a later onset, it is ethically questionable to perform pre-symptomatic testing on a child or adolescent, as there would be no medical benefit for that individual.",
         "There is consensus for testing only individuals who are considered cognitively mature, although there is a counter-argument that parents have a right to make the decision on their child's behalf.",
         "With the lack of an effective treatment, testing a person under legal age who is not judged to be competent is considered unethical in most cases.",
         "There are ethical concerns related to prenatal genetic testing or preimplantation genetic diagnosis to ensure a child is not born with a given disease.",
         "For example, prenatal testing raises the issue of selective abortion, a choice considered unacceptable by some.",

         "The group's chartered organization planned eventually to attempt to reconstitute the \"New Market Building\", a 1939 structure with an Art Deco façade and that was owned by the city, into a permanent food market.",
         "However, a real estate company, the Howard Hughes Corporation, possessed a lease for large parts of the Seaport area and desired to redevelop it, generating fears among locals that the New Market Building would be altered or destroyed.",

         "Also known as \"Little Syria\" in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the area between Battery Park and the World Trade Center site, east of West Street and west of Broadway, had been a residential area for the shipping elite of New York in the early 19th century, and turned into a substantial neighborhood of ethnic immigration in the mid-19th century.",
         "In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, centered on Washington Street, the area became well known as Little Syria, hosting immigrants from today's Lebanon, Syria, and Palestine, as well those of many other ethnic groups including Greeks, Armenians, Irish, Slovaks, and Czechs.",

         "Community and preservation groups — including the \"Friends of the Lower West Side\" and the \"Save Washington Street\" group led by St. Francis College student Carl \"Antoun\" Houck — have continued, especially, to advocate for a hearing on the Downtown Community House, arguing that its history demonstrates the multi-ethnic heritage of the neighborhood, and that its Colonial Revival architecture intentionally links the immigrants to the foundations of the country, and that preserving the three buildings together would tell a coherent story of an overlooked, but important ethnic neighborhood.",
